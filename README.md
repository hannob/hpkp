# hpkp
HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)<sup>[[1](#references)]</sup> pin generation tools.

## hpkp-gen
`hpkp-gen` will create public key pins to be used with the experimental HTTP
Public Key Pinning (HPKP) header. HPKP is a promising technology to mitigate
many problems of the current system of certificate authorities.

`hpkp-gen` can read public keys from certificates (`.crt`), private keys
(`.key`), and certificate requests (`.csr`).

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/hannob/hpkp.git
sh hpkp/hpkp-gen -s -- cert.crt cert.key
```
